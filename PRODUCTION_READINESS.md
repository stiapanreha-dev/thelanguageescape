## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Minor Gaps (Not Critical)

1. **Vosk Speech Recognition** (10% priority)
   - Current: Accepts all voice messages
   - TZ requirement: Validate pronunciation
   - Impact: Low (voice tasks still functional)
   - Recommendation: Implement in v1.1

2. **Admin Commands Expansion**
   - Current: Basic statistics and broadcast
   - Could add: User management, manual day unlock, payment refunds
   - Impact: Low (core admin features present)

3. **Channel Links**
   - Current: Hardcoded placeholder URLs
   - Need: Update to actual Telegram channel
   - Impact: Very Low (cosmetic)

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Current: No spam protection
   - Recommended: Add rate limiting middleware
   - Impact: Low (unlikely abuse case)
